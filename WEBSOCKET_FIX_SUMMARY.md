# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
WebSocket connections were failing when accessing the app from within the local network, but working when accessed externally. The issue was related to hostname resolution and network context detection.

## Root Cause
1. **Hostname Resolution**: When accessing from within the local network, `window.location.hostname` resolved to the external IP (184.186.78.18), but the WebSocket server was only accessible via localhost or local network IP.
2. **Vite HMR Configuration**: Vite's Hot Module Replacement WebSocket was trying to connect to the wrong hostname.
3. **CORS Configuration**: WebSocket CORS was only allowing connections from port 3000, but the WebSocket server runs on port 5001.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. WebSocket Service (`src/services/websocketService.ts`)
- **Intelligent Hostname Detection**: Added logic to detect whether the client is accessing from local network or externally
- **Dynamic URL Construction**: Uses `localhost:5001` for local access, external IP for external access
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed connection logging for debugging
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and retry logic

### 2. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- **HMR Configuration**: Fixed Vite's Hot Module Replacement WebSocket to use correct hostname
- **Dynamic HMR Hostname**: Uses `localhost` for development HMR connections

### 3. Server WebSocket CORS (`server/websocketService.js`)
- **Extended CORS Rules**: Added support for both port 3000 and 5001
- **Better Origin Logging**: Added logging for allowed/blocked origins

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test WebSocket Connectivity
Run the test script to verify WebSocket server accessibility:
```bash
node test-websocket-connection.js
```

### 2. Test from Different Network Contexts
1. **Local Network Test**:
   - Access the app from a device on the same local network
   - Check browser console for WebSocket connection logs
   - Verify connection status shows "Local network" context

2. **External Network Test**:
   - Access the app from outside the local network (e.g., mobile data)
   - Check browser console for WebSocket connection logs
   - Verify connection status shows "External network" context

### 3. Browser Console Verification
Look for these log messages:
```
üîå WebSocket service initialized with base URL: https://localhost:5001
üåê Network context: Local network
üìç Current location: https://184.186.78.18:3000/
üè† Hostname: 184.186.78.18
üîí Protocol: https:
```

### 4. Connection Status Check
The WebSocket service will now show:
- ‚úÖ **Local Network**: Uses `localhost:5001` for WebSocket connections
- ‚úÖ **External Network**: Uses `184.186.78.18:5001` for WebSocket connections

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Local network: WebSocket connection failed
- ‚úÖ External network: WebSocket connection worked

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Local network: WebSocket connection works
- ‚úÖ External network: WebSocket connection works

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Server Logs**: Look for CORS allow/block messages in server logs
2. **Verify Port Forwarding**: Ensure port 5001 is forwarded to your server
3. **Firewall Settings**: Check local and router firewall settings
4. **SSL Certificates**: Verify SSL certificates are properly configured

## Files Modified
- `src/services/websocketService.ts` - WebSocket client logic
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite HMR configuration
- `server/websocketService.js` - Server CORS configuration
- `test-websocket-connection.js` - Testing script (new)

## Network Architecture
```
External Network:
Browser ‚Üí 184.186.78.18:3000 (Vite) ‚Üí 184.186.78.18:5001 (WebSocket)

Local Network:
Browser ‚Üí 184.186.78.18:3000 (Vite) ‚Üí localhost:5001 (WebSocket)
