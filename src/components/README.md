## Component Architecture

### Design Patterns

#### Composition Pattern
Components are built using composition for maximum flexibility:
```typescript
<ConditionalImageField
  label="Engine Air Filter"
  condition={condition}
  conditionOptions={options}
  photos={photos}
  renderContent={() => <CustomContent />}
/>
```

#### Render Props Pattern
Advanced components use render props for customization:
```typescript
<ImageUploadField
  photos={photos}
  renderPreview={(photo) => <CustomPreview photo={photo} />}
  renderControls={() => <CustomControls />}
/>
```

#### Higher-Order Components
Cross-cutting concerns handled with HOCs:
```typescript
const EnhancedComponent = withErrorBoundary(
  withLoading(
    withAuthentication(BaseComponent)
  )
);
```

### State Management Integration

Components integrate with multiple state management systems:
- **Zustand Stores**: Business module-specific state
- **React Context**: Global application state
- **Local State**: Component-specific state
- **Form State**: React Hook Form integration

### TypeScript Integration

All components are fully typed with:
- **Interface Definitions**: Comprehensive prop typing
- **Generic Components**: Reusable with different data types
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type validation
- **Utility Types**: Helper types for component development

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Visual Tests**: UI regression testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance validation

### Testing Utilities
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ComponentWrapper } from '../test-utils';

describe('ImageUploadField', () => {
  it('handles image upload correctly', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memoization
```typescript
const OptimizedComponent = React.memo(BaseComponent, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison logic
});
```

### Lazy Loading
```typescript
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./ExpensiveComponent'));
```

### Virtual Scrolling
Large lists use virtual scrolling for performance:
```typescript
<VirtualizedList
  items={items}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Selection
- **Business Components**: Use module-specific components for business logic
- **Core Components**: Use core components for common UI patterns
- **Utility Components**: Use utility components for cross-cutting concerns

### Best Practices
1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer composition for component design
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, clear purpose
3. **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript interfaces for props
4. **Error Handling**: Include error boundaries for complex components
5. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for all components
6. **Performance**: Use memoization and lazy loading appropriately
7. **Testing**: Include comprehensive tests for all components

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Components
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Components for multi-user editing
- **Advanced Analytics**: Data visualization components
- **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile-specific component variants
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support components

### Architecture Evolution
- **Micro-frontends**: Component federation and sharing
- **Design System**: Comprehensive design system integration
- **Performance**: Advanced performance optimization
- **Testing**: Enhanced testing utilities and coverage
